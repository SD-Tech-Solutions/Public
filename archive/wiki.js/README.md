# TheKyleStyle Wiki made with Wiki.js

There isnt much to this install, it's just a copy of the official docker compose installation file.  
Here is the [Official Install Guide](https://docs.requarks.io/install) and 
a shortcut to the [docker-compose section](https://docs.requarks.io/install/docker#using-docker-compose).

1. Create a folder called wiki
2. Create `docker-compose.yaml` and copy my file.
3. ***While in the same folder*** use the command `docker-compose up -d`
4. Go to http://[ip-address] in your browser (assuming you used the default port 80)
