I am Kyle and here are links to some services.

Also, if you feel the need to send me anything encrypted, you can use [my public key](sd-tech-github-published-key.pub) to encrypt it.

This wiki style site is built using [Wiki.js](https://js.wiki) and running on a debian computer I have at home.
Here is a link to the [docker compose file template](/archive/wiki/docker-compose.yaml) I used to build it.
